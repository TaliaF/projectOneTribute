<h1>A tribute to</h1>
  <h2>John Denver</h2>

<span style="font-weight:600; font-size:30px;">"</span>Henry John Deutschendorf Jr. definitely is not a name that any record company, manager, or publicist would have an artist use as their stage name. A member of one of his favorite musical acts, The New Christy Minstrels also agreed, urging the developing folk singer to adopt a more marketable name. He chose John Denver and the stage was set for one of the biggest decades of any artists’ career.

In the early 1970s, America was beginning to long for a simpler way of life – as evidenced by the success of television series The Waltons and Little House On The Prairie. At the heart of that era from a musical standpoint was the easy-going and gentle sound that Denver personified. Whether it be love songs, nostalgia, or paying tribute to the area where he was from, Denver became one of the biggest-selling acts of his time, dominating Pop, AC, and Country playlists, while also becoming a huge TV and movie star. It goes without saying that many of the compositions in our list of essential John Denver songs come from the 1970s, but a few later recordings show that his music -- and talent -- were timeless pieces of Americana -- before that was a word or a format.<span style="font-weight:600; font-size:30px;">"</span><br /><br />- Chuck Dauphin, 2017</p>
